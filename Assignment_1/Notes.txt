Notes for Time:

Times (measured on Gantenbein):
-> Compiled with -O0:
    between 2.378s and 2.459s    
-> Compiled with -O1:
    between 0.265s and 0.281s
-> Compiled with -O2:
    between 939ns and 3336ns
-> Compiled with -O3:
    between 946ns and 3000ns
-> Compiled with -Os:
    between 0.268s and 0.270s
-> Compiled with -Og:
    between 0.535s and 0.552s

Notes to assembly code:
    the higher the optimization level, the smaller the assembly code
    which makes sense but is also an indication that it is harder to 
    find a bug in the optimized assembly code
